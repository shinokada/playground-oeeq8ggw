# Ones' Complement

The first bit (MSB) is the same as the signed magnitude. It tells a positive by 0 or negative by 1. 

The rest of the bits will take the compliment, which means if it is 1 the complement is 0 and if it is 0, then the complement is 1.

The signed onesâ€™ complement has the same problem as the signed magnitude. There are two zeros, `0000` and `1111`.
